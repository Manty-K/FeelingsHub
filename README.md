## 💡 Inspiration
Mental health is a major concern worldwide and India is not far behind in sharing this. About 14% of the global burden of disease is attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders and in India WHO estimates that the burden of mental health problems in India is 2443 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100 00 population and the suicide rate percentage due to mental health is 21.1 percent in the last few years and it had increased more due to spread of covid 19 virus. Mental health, loneliness, depression, etc are all serious issues in modern times but people are afraid to talk about them. Indian societies consider mental health as taboo due to which people are more afraid to talk about it and instead of getting support and help from society they suffer alone. People who suffer from mental illness needed a medium to talk, to express themselves, they needed support and motivation. By remarking this importance we are creating an app where people who suffer from mental health can talk openly, share their problems and difficulties and get motivated, and be guided properly so that they can enjoy their life to the fullest of its means. That's our sole purpose of making this app to bring happiness back to the life of people.

## 📱 What it does
Find the motivation and positive mindset one needs to succeed with daily encouragement. This app is designed to inspire with positive affirmations and self-talk — a proven technique to make one's mind work for himself/herself. Choose the ones that resonate with your goals and learn how to reduce negative self-talk.
 
Our app is a one on one interacting chatting app where if you are suffering from mental health or you are depressed or just feeling low you can interact with highly motivated and enthusiastic people with whom you can interact and share all your problems and difficulties and get good suggestions, recommendations, and proper guidance.
 
This app features handpicked motivational videos, quotes, and blogs from top motivational speakers around the world. It also covers the top asked questions and their answers for the people who are suffering from mental health and the people who wanted to be aware of mental health.

## 🔨 How we built it
We have utilized Flutter to build this app because it supports all mobile platforms. For the Admin page, we utilized HTML and Firebase as the database for the app.

We created APIs using Python and Flask and hosted them on Linode.

Furthermore to build the presentation slide we used Canva and then to build our initial prototype before hard-coding the app we used Figma & Draw.io

## 💪 Challenges we ran into
We all are students, so we had a hard time managing this project and our lectures. Additionally, this was the first hackathon for the team. Despite all the challenges we faced, in the end, we were successfully able to finish our features and site and record the demo video.

## 🧠 What we learned
Overall, Hackathon had an amazing source of learning for the Team.
We learned to work in a team by distributing tasks. We participated in mini-events and got to connect with other "Hackers" & Mentors. In technical aspects, we learned flutter, API development, Linux (for Linode).
